## Summary

7 Days to Die mod: update trader restock date and vending expiration date to show days until vs date of.

This mod does not alter the actual days within a server (many components in the game rely on server/world time increasing); it simply updates how the days are reported for Trader Restock and the Rentable Vending Machine Expiration Date.

## Sister Project

This mod is designed to be used with another to complete your experience:

- [Days of the Week](https://github.com/jonathan-robertson/days-of-the-week)
  - Replace days count in UI with a day of the week
  - *be sure to use the `windows-days-remaining.xml` option in this mod to get the best experience*
