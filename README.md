## Summary

7 Days to Die mod: update expiration date for vending machine rental from 'date of' to 'days until'.

## Features

1. Vending Machine Rental Expiration: replaces the existing 'date of' expiration value with a new value representing the number of remaining 'days until' expiration.
   - NOTE: this mod does not alter the actual days within a server (many components in the game rely on server/world time increasing); it simply updates how the days are reported for the Rentable Vending Machine Expiration Date.
2. Expiration Reminders: a quick buff-powered reminder will display on your screen to ensure you're aware of the days until your vending machine expires:
   - when logging in
   - when a new day triggers (at midnight)

## Sister Project

This mod is designed to be used with another to complete your experience:

- [Days of the Week](https://github.com/jonathan-robertson/days-of-the-week)
  - Replace days count in UI with a day of the week
  - *be sure to use the `windows-days-remaining.xml` option in this mod to get the best experience*
